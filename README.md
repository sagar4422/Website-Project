# Website-Project
In this repository I am adding the code that is related to my website called Ethereum which is still under construction,
This website includes information related to an open source, blockchain based distributed computing platform called Ethereum.
This project includes a css file, few html files and images that were used in designing the website.
This is actually my first website project that I have developed using bootstap framework apart from this I am also managing the website on a free subdomain.
As this website is in beta version so interested viewers can give their feedback by clicking on "Let's Go" that is present in the home page of the website button which will direct you to a google form.

Happy coding...
